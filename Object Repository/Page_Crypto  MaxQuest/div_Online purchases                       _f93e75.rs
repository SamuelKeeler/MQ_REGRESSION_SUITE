                      Online purchases: 
                      Your cryptocurrency is a legal way to purchase a villa in the Swiss Alps, pay your dentist, do your online shopping on Amazon, or to buy your Max Coins at MaxQuest. 
                      An investment tool: 
                      Bitcoin has been the best performing asset in the last 10 years. Unlike traditional currencies such as the U.S. Dollars and Euros, which are printed repeatedly without any backing, Bitcoin has a maximum capacity. 
                      Transactions of value: 
                      Crypto carries inherent value. It's a secure, fast and relatively cheap transaction method that can cross any border. For example, if you plan on cashing out winnings earned at a one of MaxQuest exciting tournaments, your withdrawal will be fast, cheap and easy as it will take several days to be processed through a Bank or Western Union. 
                      Thanks to the Blockchain, funds are kept with their rightful owners, and not whittled down by middlemen and intermediary services. 
                      Advantages of cryptocurrencies 
                       
                        Decentralized assets - All you really need is a crypto wallet address set up to send/receive funds, as well as an Internet connection.  
                        International transfers - Cryptocurrencies hold the same value across the globe. This means you no longer need to worry about currency conversions and excessive transfer fees.  
                        Reduced Costs - By cutting out the middle man, cryptocurrencies are cheaper. You won't have to deal with Banks or Card issuers at all.  
                        Faster transactions - By taking Banks out of the equation, you'll be able to make daily transactions quickly and efficiently.  
                       
                      Crypto Cold Storage 
                      MaxQuest is, and will remain, a stable and secure platform. We use the cold storage method to ensure unbeatable safety for your funds. 
                      Cold storage means that your funds aren't held on our web server or any other computer, but instead on an external storage device. It's how we offer you an extra layer of anti-hacker security. 
                      All funds are fully hedged on one of the largest global exchanges and are never impacted by BTC fluctuations. 
                       Top Tier Payment Processing 
                      There's nothing better than a fast and easy deposit and withdrawal procedure. That's why we only partner up with established, reliable and hassle-free payment processors.

                      Advantages of cryptocurrencies 
                       
                        Decentralized assets - All you really need is a crypto wallet address set up to send/receive funds, as well as an Internet connection.  
                        International transfers - Cryptocurrencies hold the same value across the globe. This means you no longer need to worry about currency conversions and excessive transfer fees.  
                        Reduced Costs - By cutting out the middle man, cryptocurrencies are cheaper. You won&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;t have to deal with Banks or Card issuers at all.  
                        Faster transactions - By taking Banks out of the equation, you&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;ll be able to make daily transactions quickly and efficiently.

                      Online purchases: 
                      Your cryptocurrency is a legal way to purchase a villa in the Swiss Alps, pay your dentist, do your online shopping on Amazon, or to buy your Max Coins at MaxQuest. 
                      An investment tool: 
                      Bitcoin has been the best performing asset in the last 10 years. Unlike traditional currencies such as the U.S. Dollars and Euros, which are printed repeatedly without any backing, Bitcoin has a maximum capacity. 
                      Transactions of value: 
                      Crypto carries inherent value. It&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;s a secure, fast and relatively cheap transaction method that can cross any border. For example, if you plan on cashing out winnings earned at a one of MaxQuest exciting tournaments, your withdrawal will be fast, cheap and easy as it will take several days to be processed through a Bank or Western Union. 
                      Thanks to the Blockchain, funds are kept with their rightful owners, and not whittled down by middlemen and intermediary services.
