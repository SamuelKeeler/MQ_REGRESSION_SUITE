                 When you choose to withdraw Prizes for cryptocurrency, the payment will be made to the Payment Medium from which you purchased your Coin Pack. If this is not technically possible, then to an alternative account you nominate, provided that account is legally and beneficially owned by you. We reserve the right to require the use of the same payment method for withdrawal of Prizes as was used to purchase Coin Packs. 
                 
                Withdrawal Limits and Fees 
                 
                 We reserve the right to charge fees for processing the withdrawal of Prizes. 
                 The minimum withdrawal amount in a single transaction is  100 Max Coins (MC). 
                 We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to limit the value of Prize withdrawals for each Participant to 2,500 Max Coins (MC) per day. 
                 
                Accuracy of Details for Withdrawals 
                 
                 It is your sole responsibility to ensure that the email address and crypto wallet details provided are accurate. If the details you have provided are not accurate, and we have processed the withdrawal using the details you have provided, the withdrawal of that Prize is complete and we are not required to reissue the Prize. 
                 We will not make payments into an account or online wallet which does not match your verified name or the name you provided when registering your Player Account, or that is not legally and beneficially owned by you. 
                 
                Currency 
                 
                 All Coin Pack purchases are executed in USD value. It is the Player's responsibility to ensure that, upon depositing and withdrawing, the correct and exact amount of cryptocurrency is being transacted. 
                 All foreign exchange transaction fees, charges or related costs that you may incur as a result of, or in relation to, payments made by the MQ Technology DWC-LLC to you are to be borne solely by you, including but not limited to any losses or additional costs arising from foreign exchange fluctuations.

                 We will only process one Prize withdrawal request per Player Account in any 24-48 hour period. 
                 There may be delays in payments due to our standard verification process.  
                 Withdrawals over  2,000 Max Coins may require a longer processing time due to security and fraud checks, and may also be paid in more than one lump sum. 
                 If you request a withdrawal without turning over an amount that is equal or more than the amount purchased, we may require you to make a turnover of the full purchase as per MaxQuest requirements.  
                 Withdrawal requests suspected of breaching our anti-money laundering policies will be rejected.  
                 Prior to accepting a withdrawal we may request that you provide legal identification. This could include certified copies of passports, ID cards or other such documentation as we feel is required in the circumstances. We may also carry out phone verification, face verification or other such verification as is required to confirm the identity of the user. 
                  Players can request to withdraw Prizes of any value within our withdrawal requirements; however, we reserve the right to allocate or pay Prizes in smaller increments over a number of days until all of the Prize has been allocated or paid. 
                 
                Payment Administration Agents 
                 
                 You acknowledge and agree that we may in our sole discretion, from time to time, appoint one or more Payment Administration Agents to accept or make payments (including merchant facilities) from or to Players on our behalf.

In no event will we be liable to any Player for any loss, damage or liability resulting from the Payment Administration Agent’s negligence and/or acts beyond the authority given by MQ Technology DWC-LLC. 
                 
                Expiry and Forfeiture 
                 
                 Max Coin validity varies depending on how the coins were acquired. promotional Coin validity is stipulated by the main terms of each particular promotion. Purchased Coin Packs do not expire, and are only forfeited after 12 consecutive months of account inactivity.   
                 Max Coins may be forfeited if a Player Account is deactivated for any reason, or at our discretion. 
                 
                Updating Payment Details

We cannot update or add additional payment details on your behalf. 
                 
                Mistaken Credits 
                 
                 If your Player Account is incorrectly credited with Prizes that do not belong to you, whether due to a technical error, human error or otherwise, the amount credited will remain MQ Technology DWC-LLC property and will be deducted from your Player Account. If you withdraw said incorrect credits prior to us becoming aware of the error, the mistakenly paid amount will (without prejudice to other remedies and actions that may be available at law) constitute a debt owed by you to us. In the event of an incorrect crediting, you are obliged to notify Customer Support immediately.

MQ Technology DWC-LLC agrees that we will take all reasonable efforts to contact you and resolve any claim it may possess informally prior to taking any formal action. Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers’; satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you permanently and irrevocably waive your rights to bring any claim in connection with your use of the Platform unless you bring it within two (2) years of the date of the event giving rise to such claim. 
                 EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY TO BE HEARD IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU, ON THE ONE HAND, AND MQ TECHNOLOGY DWC-LLC OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, OR SUPPLIERS, ON THE OTHER HAND, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY.

YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY AND THAT CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU HEREBY AGREE TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN COURT OR ARBITRATION. 
                 The arbitration will be administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitrations Rules, as appropriate, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at http://www.jamsadr.com/ or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient to the parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination will be made by the JAMS or by the arbitrator. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will, to the extent required to make this Section 13 enforceable, pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. The arbitrator will be bound by these Terms, when not in conflict with applicable law, and the arbitrator’s decision will be binding and final, subject only to limited right of judicial review provided under the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. If the arbitrator decides that either the substance of your claim or the remedy you asked for is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, we may use the applicable Rules to determine whether you are responsible for the filing, administrative and arbitrator fees. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local government agencies or from seeking public injunctive relief in court where that right cannot be waived under applicable state law. 
                 If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place in Dallas County, Texas. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Dallas County, Texas, and you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Dallas County, Texas, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgement on the award entered by the arbitrator. 
                 To not be bound by the arbitration agreement set forth in this Section 20, within 30 days of using our Platform, you must notify MQ Technology DWC-LLC in writing of your intent to opt-out of the arbitration provisions. The written intent to opt-out must include your first and last name, and be provided either by: (1) sending an email to support@maxquest.com; or (2) sending a letter to the following address: Dubai South Business Center, Building C, 3rd Floor, Dubai Logistic City, PO BOX 390667, Dubai, U.A.E.

                 These Terms and Conditions are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the United States and the State of Texas without regards to the conflicts of law principles thereof. If any clause or provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such clause or provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining clauses or provisions of these Terms and Conditions, including but not limited to the class action waiver. You expressly agree that if you dispute the validity or enforceability of the individual arbitration provision and/or class action waiver in these Terms, you shall bring such dispute in the courts of the State of Texas situated in Dallas County, and you expressly consent and agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts. 
                 All claims arising in connection with your use of the Platform should be reported and brought to our attention as soon as possible to Customer Support in accordance with Section 17 above. MQ Technology DWC-LLC agrees that we will take all reasonable efforts to contact you and resolve any claim it may possess informally prior to taking any formal action.

                 The arbitration will be administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitrations Rules, as appropriate, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at http://www.jamsadr.com/ or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient to the parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination will be made by the JAMS or by the arbitrator. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will, to the extent required to make this Section 13 enforceable, pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. The arbitrator will be bound by these Terms, when not in conflict with applicable law, and the arbitrator’s decision will be binding and final, subject only to limited right of judicial review provided under the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. If the arbitrator decides that either the substance of your claim or the remedy you asked for is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, we may use the applicable Rules to determine whether you are responsible for the filing, administrative and arbitrator fees. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local government agencies or from seeking public injunctive relief in court where that right cannot be waived under applicable state law. 
                 If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place in Dallas County, Texas. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Dallas County, Texas, and you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Dallas County, Texas, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgement on the award entered by the arbitrator. 
                 To not be bound by the arbitration agreement set forth in this Section 20, within 30 days of using our Platform, you must notify MQ Technology DWC-LLC in writing of your intent to opt-out of the arbitration provisions.

                 MaxQuest is wholly committed to the fight against money laundering. We have implemented an educational program for all personnel to complete during their initial training. This program focuses on the fundamentals of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and our internal Compliance Procedures. 
                 Having successfully completed the internal program, all players are required to read, acknowledge and act in accordance with MaxQuest’s Anti-Money Laundering &amp; Compliance Procedures Manual. 
                 Money laundering is the term used for the concealment of illegally obtained money, typically by means of transfers involving foreign banks and legitimate financial institutions. 
                 MaxQuest will maintain a written document of AML policy and procedures and a system of internal controls to ensure ongoing AML compliance by a designated person(s) and to take appropriate action, once suspicious activity is detected. MaxQuest will comply with applicable anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws and regulations wherever possible. 
                 MaxQuest’s Anti-Money Laundering policies apply to all business units and departments. These are designed to protect MaxQuest from money laundering and terrorist financing. 
                 All identified suspicious activities must be reported to the extent of all applicable foreign and domestic laws. 
                 All client-related documents will be preserved for a period that will not be less than five (5) years or in accordance with law requirements. 
                 MaxQuest will cooperate fully with law enforcement and regulatory agencies to the extent that it can do so under all applicable laws in the event that there is cause to believe that a breach in AML procedures has occurred. 
                 Should you have any further questions regarding the Anti-Money Laundering policy, contact Customer Support via Live Chat or Email, or review our full AML Policy here.

                 These Terms and Conditions are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the United States and the State of Texas without regards to the conflicts of law principles thereof. If any clause or provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such clause or provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining clauses or provisions of these Terms and Conditions, including but not limited to the class action waiver. You expressly agree that if you dispute the validity or enforceability of the individual arbitration provision and/or class action waiver in these Terms, you shall bring such dispute in the courts of the State of Texas situated in Dallas County, and you expressly consent and agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts. 
                 All claims arising in connection with your use of the Platform should be reported and brought to our attention as soon as possible to Customer Support in accordance with Section 17 above. MQ Technology DWC-LLC agrees that we will take all reasonable efforts to contact you and resolve any claim it may possess informally prior to taking any formal action. Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers’; satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you permanently and irrevocably waive your rights to bring any claim in connection with your use of the Platform unless you bring it within two (2) years of the date of the event giving rise to such claim. 
                 EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY TO BE HEARD IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU, ON THE ONE HAND, AND MQ TECHNOLOGY DWC-LLC OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, OR SUPPLIERS, ON THE OTHER HAND, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY.

                 The arbitration will be administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitrations Rules, as appropriate, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at http://www.jamsadr.com/ or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient to the parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination will be made by the JAMS or by the arbitrator. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will, to the extent required to make this Section 13 enforceable, pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. The arbitrator will be bound by these Terms, when not in conflict with applicable law, and the arbitrator’s decision will be binding and final, subject only to limited right of judicial review provided under the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. If the arbitrator decides that either the substance of your claim or the remedy you asked for is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, we may use the applicable Rules to determine whether you are responsible for the filing, administrative and arbitrator fees. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local government agencies or from seeking public injunctive relief in court where that right cannot be waived under applicable state law. 
                 If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place in Dallas County, Texas. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Dallas County, Texas, and you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Dallas County, Texas, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgement on the award entered by the arbitrator. 
                 To not be bound by the arbitration agreement set forth in this Section 20, within 30 days of using our Platform, you must notify MQ Technology DWC-LLC in writing of your intent to opt-out of the arbitration provisions.

                 The arbitration will be administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitrations Rules, as appropriate, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at http://www.jamsadr.com/ or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient to the parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination will be made by the JAMS or by the arbitrator. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will, to the extent required to make this Section 13 enforceable, pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. The arbitrator will be bound by these Terms, when not in conflict with applicable law, and the arbitrator’s decision will be binding and final, subject only to limited right of judicial review provided under the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. If the arbitrator decides that either the substance of your claim or the remedy you asked for is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, we may use the applicable Rules to determine whether you are responsible for the filing, administrative and arbitrator fees. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local government agencies or from seeking public injunctive relief in court where that right cannot be waived under applicable state law. 
                 If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place in Dallas County, Texas. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Dallas County, Texas, and you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Dallas County, Texas, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgement on the award entered by the arbitrator.
