                         MaxQuest offers players two modes, Battleground (PvP) and Fastfire (single player). Each mode grants access to multiple Worlds (themes). In each World, the objective is to apply your skills to win prizes. The prizes you collect depend on the World and the game mode. They include coins, prize pots, and even Special Weapons. The better you play, the more you win.

                         MaxQuest offers two currencies; Quest Coins and Max Coins. Playing with Quest Coins offers the ability for players to enjoy action games and casino games in a free to play, no purchase required mode. This gives the opportunity for players to practice their skills playing FastFire, Battleground, Triple Max Blast, and any other MaxQuest casino games risk free. To win crypto prizes head to the Max Coins lobby where players are winning prizes based on their skill and performance. Using Max Coins allows players to earn cryptocurrency playing FastFire, Battleground and Triple Max Blast. The better you play, the more you win.

                         You can only earn Max Coins as a free bonus when purchasing Quest Coin Packs, as a daily bonus each time you log in to your MaxQuest account, or when you refer a friend. We'll also reward you with Max Coins in special competitions and tournaments or when you hit milestones. Any winnings from Max Coins can be withdrawn to your Crypto wallet, as long as you meet the withdrawal requirements.

                         Quest Coins are a virtual non-monetary currency used to play any of the games in the Quest Coin lobby. Just like play-for-fun arcades, Quest Coins can't be cashed out or traded for real money. You can use your Quest Coins to play games and join sweepstakes or tournaments. Perfect for improving your game before heading to the Max Coin lobby to win real crypto.

                         Your Max Coins and Quest Coins can expire, depending on their type: - Max Coins earned when a player purchases a Coin Pack do not expire unless their account is inactive for 12 consecutive months - Max Coins earned with the Welcome offer are valid for 60 days from the date of registration. - Daily Max Coins added to your account will expire after 7 days. - Max Coins earned by referring friends are valid for 30 days.

                         If a Battleground game is interrupted due to a MaxQuest error, you'll automatically be refunded your buy-in and seating fee. If the error was beyond our control, you'll only be refunded your buy-in. If the interruption occurs during Fastfire, please contact Customer Support for a manual refund.

                         Crypto transactions can't be reverted. Once the funds have been sent from your crypto wallet to a a crypto address, the transaction is final. 
                         Once you select the Coin Pack you want to purchase, you'll have 15 minutes to send the funds. If you choose not to deposit within that time, the request will simply timeout and no further action is needed. 
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         How will I know when my funds read my MaxQuest account?   
                        
                        
                         
                         Once funds have been received and confirmed on the Blockchain network, they'll be credited to your balance automatically. You'll also get an email notification to confirm the successful transaction.

                         If funds are sent from your Crypto wallet, they will be credited once they reach 6 confirmations. This process can take up to 6 hours and depends on the blockchain network. Once the funds are received, they are instantly and automatically credited to your Balance.

                         You can check the progress of your deposit using the Bitcoin address that was generated when you first opened the request here.

                         How do I make purchases if I’m totally new to crypto?

                         Are there withdrawal fees?   
                        
                        
                         
                         There are no fees for withdrawing by cryptocurrencies but prices might fluctuate due to the volatility of crypto and the spot rate, which is driven by multiple factors.

                         I submitted a withdrawal request and my funds are locked, why?   
                        
                        
                         
                         When submitting a withdrawal request, your funds enter a locked status while our Payments Team conduct their standard verification checks.

                         I transferred the funds to an incorrect wallet address, what should I do?   
                        
                        
                         
                         It's important to take care to enter the correct Bitcoin address. The only way to attempt to access funds submitted to an incorrect wallet address is to try and contact the owner if you know the person's identity.  
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         Why do I have to upload documentation?   
                        
                        
                         
                         Our Customer Support team might ask you to upload identity verification documents through your account section once you've been playing at MaxQuest for a while. This is a legal requirement that helps us to keep MaxQuest a safe place to play.

                         MaxQuest offers players two modes, Battleground (PvP) and Fastfire (single player). Each mode grants access to multiple Worlds (themes). In each World, the objective is to apply your skills to win prizes. The prizes you collect depend on the World and the game mode. They include coins, prize pots, and even Special Weapons. The better you play, the more you win.

                         Quest Coins are a virtual non-monetary currency used to play any of the games in the Quest Coin lobby.

Perfect for improving your game before heading to the Max Coin lobby to win real crypto.

If the error was beyond our control, you&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;ll only be refunded your buy-in. If the interruption occurs during Fastfire, please contact Customer Support for a manual refund.

                         Are there fees for deposits and withdrawals on MaxQuest?   
                        
                        
                         
                         MaxQuest will never take any fees for deposits or withdrawals. But you should keep in mind that all Crypto transactions are subject to blockchain network and miner fees.

                         Crypto transactions can&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;t be reverted. Once the funds have been sent from your crypto wallet to a a crypto address, the transaction is final. 
                         Once you select the Coin Pack you want to purchase, you&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;ll have 15 minutes to send the funds. If you choose not to deposit within that time, the request will simply timeout and no further action is needed. 
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         How will I know when my funds read my MaxQuest account?   
                        
                        
                         
                         Once funds have been received and confirmed on the Blockchain network, they&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;ll be credited to your balance automatically. You&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;ll also get an email notification to confirm the successful transaction. 
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         How long does it take for a purchase to reach my account?   
                        
                        
                         
                         If funds are sent from your Crypto wallet, they will be credited once they reach 6 confirmations. This process can take up to 6 hours and depends on the blockchain network. Once the funds are received, they are instantly and automatically credited to your Balance. 
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         How can I track my deposit?   
                        
                        
                         
                         You can check the progress of your deposit using the Bitcoin address that was generated when you first opened the request here.

                         We accept payment exclusively in cryptocurrency, either Bitcoin, Litecoin, Tether, or Ethereum.

                         How do I make purchases if I already have a crypto wallet?   
                        
                        
                         
                         Navigate to the purchase page and choose the Coin Pack that works for you. Select CoinsPaid to begin the transaction.

                         How do I make purchases if I’m totally new to crypto?   
                        
                        
                         
                         Navigate to the purchase page and choose the Coin Pack that works for you. Select the MaxQuest Wallet. If it’s your first purchase, register and accept the terms.

                         Are there withdrawal fees?   
                        
                        
                         
                         There are no fees for withdrawing by cryptocurrencies but prices might fluctuate due to the volatility of crypto and the spot rate, which is driven by multiple factors. 
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         How do I make a withdrawal?   
                        
                        
                         
                         Head to your dashboard. Under your balance, you&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;ll see &quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;Withdraw Coins&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;, where you can select the cryptocurrency you want to withdraw to your account as well as the amount and wallet address where you wish to send the funds. Your withdrawal request will be reviewed within 24 hours. Processing can take up to 6 hours and depends on the blockchain network.

                         How long does it take to withdraw?

                         I submitted a withdrawal request and my funds are locked, why?   
                        
                        
                         
                         When submitting a withdrawal request, your funds enter a locked status while our Payments Team conduct their standard verification checks. 
                         If you wish to continue playing, you can simply cancel the withdrawal from within your Transaction History.  
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         I transferred the funds to an incorrect wallet address, what should I do?   
                        
                        
                         
                         It&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;s important to take care to enter the correct Bitcoin address. The only way to attempt to access funds submitted to an incorrect wallet address is to try and contact the owner if you know the person&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;s identity.  
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         Why do I have to upload documentation?   
                        
                        
                         
                         Our Customer Support team might ask you to upload identity verification documents through your account section once you&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;ve been playing at MaxQuest for a while. This is a legal requirement that helps us to keep MaxQuest a safe place to play.

                         Quest Coins are a virtual non-monetary currency used to play any of the games in the Quest Coin lobby. Just like play-for-fun arcades, Quest Coins can&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;t be cashed out or traded for real money. You can use your Quest Coins to play games and join sweepstakes or tournaments. Perfect for improving your game before heading to the Max Coin lobby to win real crypto.

                         Are there fees for deposits and withdrawals on MaxQuest?   
                        
                        
                         
                         MaxQuest will never take any fees for deposits or withdrawals. But you should keep in mind that all Crypto transactions are subject to blockchain network and miner fees. 
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         How do I cancel a Coin Pack purchase?   
                        
                        
                         
                         Crypto transactions can&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;t be reverted. Once the funds have been sent from your crypto wallet to a a crypto address, the transaction is final. 
                         Once you select the Coin Pack you want to purchase, you&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;ll have 15 minutes to send the funds. If you choose not to deposit within that time, the request will simply timeout and no further action is needed. 
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         How will I know when my funds read my MaxQuest account?   
                        
                        
                         
                         Once funds have been received and confirmed on the Blockchain network, they&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;ll be credited to your balance automatically. You&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;ll also get an email notification to confirm the successful transaction. 
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         How long does it take for a purchase to reach my account?   
                        
                        
                         
                         If funds are sent from your Crypto wallet, they will be credited once they reach 6 confirmations. This process can take up to 6 hours and depends on the blockchain network. Once the funds are received, they are instantly and automatically credited to your Balance. 
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         How can I track my deposit?   
                        
                        
                         
                         You can check the progress of your deposit using the Bitcoin address that was generated when you first opened the request here. 
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         What deposit options are available at MaxQuest?   
                        
                        
                         
                         We accept payment exclusively in cryptocurrency, either Bitcoin, Litecoin, Tether, or Ethereum.

                         How do I make purchases if I already have a crypto wallet?   
                        
                        
                         
                         Navigate to the purchase page and choose the Coin Pack that works for you. Select CoinsPaid to begin the transaction.

                         How do I make purchases if I’m totally new to crypto?   
                        
                        
                         
                         Navigate to the purchase page and choose the Coin Pack that works for you. Select the MaxQuest Wallet. If it’s your first purchase, register and accept the terms.

                         Are there withdrawal fees?   
                        
                        
                         
                         There are no fees for withdrawing by cryptocurrencies but prices might fluctuate due to the volatility of crypto and the spot rate, which is driven by multiple factors. 
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         How do I make a withdrawal?   
                        
                        
                         
                         Head to your dashboard. Under your balance, you&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;ll see &quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;Withdraw Coins&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;, where you can select the cryptocurrency you want to withdraw to your account as well as the amount and wallet address where you wish to send the funds. Your withdrawal request will be reviewed within 24 hours. Processing can take up to 6 hours and depends on the blockchain network. Once the funds are received, they are automatically credited to your Crypto Wallet. 
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         How long does it take to withdraw?   
                        
                        
                         
                         Withdrawals are reviewed by our payments team within 24 hours or less. They conduct security checks to ensure that funds are being sent out to the correct person. Check your Email for updated or to get in touch with our 24/7 support team via Live Chat should you have any pending withdrawals. 
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         I submitted a withdrawal request and my funds are locked, why?   
                        
                        
                         
                         When submitting a withdrawal request, your funds enter a locked status while our Payments Team conduct their standard verification checks. 
                         If you wish to continue playing, you can simply cancel the withdrawal from within your Transaction History.  
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         I transferred the funds to an incorrect wallet address, what should I do?   
                        
                        
                         
                         It&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;s important to take care to enter the correct Bitcoin address. The only way to attempt to access funds submitted to an incorrect wallet address is to try and contact the owner if you know the person&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;s identity.  
                         
                        
                       
                       
                         Why do I have to upload documentation?   
                        
                        
                         
                         Our Customer Support team might ask you to upload identity verification documents through your account section once you&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;ve been playing at MaxQuest for a while. This is a legal requirement that helps us to keep MaxQuest a safe place to play.
