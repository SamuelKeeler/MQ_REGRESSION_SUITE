                    MaxQuest's Company Policy Statement: Introduction: MaxQuest is wholly committed to the fight against money laundering. As part of our commitment to combat and eliminate money laundering, we have implemented an educational program for all personnel to complete during their initial training. This program focuses on the fundamentals of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and our internal Compliance Procedures. Having successfully completed the internal program, all clients are required to read, acknowledge and act in accordance with MaxQuest’s Anti-Money Laundering &amp; Compliance Procedures Manual. Definitions: Money laundering is the term used for the concealment of illegally obtained money, typically by means of transfers involving foreign banks and legitimate financial institutions. Placement is the process of placing unlawful proceeds into traditional financial institutions. Layering is the process of separating any proceeds of any form of illegal activity from their origin, through the use of layers of complex financial transactions, initially hiding cash into money orders, wire transfers, or most relevant to MaxQuest’s Business Model, which would be purchasing packages. Suspicious Activity is activity conducted by a user or non-user using the product, where there are indications that the persons are engaging in any form of fraudulent or illegal activity. Principles: The key principles of the “Anti-Money Laundering Statement” are that:MaxQuest will maintain a written document of AML policy and procedures and a system of internal controls to ensure ongoing AML compliance by a designated person(s) and to take appropriate action, once suspicious activity is detected. MaxQuest will comply with applicable anti-money laundering &amp; terrorist financing laws and regulations wherever possible. MaxQuest’s Anti-Money Laundering policies apply to all business units and departments.Protect MaxQuestfrom money laundering &amp; terrorist financing. All identified suspicious activities must be reported to the extent of all applicable foreign and domestic laws. All the Client’s related documents will be preserved for a period that will not be less than five (5) years or in accordance with law requirements. MaxQuest will cooperate fully with law enforcement and regulatory agencies to the extent that it can do so under all applicable laws in the event that there is cause to believe that a breach in AML procedures has occurred. Should you have any further questions regarding the Anti-Money Laundering policy, email our support team or contact us via our online chat for further clarification or assistance. MaxQuest’s intention is to have the best practices in guarding its products being used to facilitate. Please find attached practices below:

We do not accept cash directly or cash delivered to any payment solution provider. Identity verification of a customer may be requested upon a threshold the amount of two thousand Max Coins ($2000) in withdrawals, whether such threshold was reached in a single transaction or consecutive requests within a rolling period of 90 days. Following this, an audit trail is taken into consideration upon each withdrawal request, taking purchases of customer’s packages also. We may also carry out these verification procedures even in case of lower purchases or in case of any withdrawals. We are subject to request verification from any customer at any given time, depending on our analysis of the behavior of the customer in question.  
                   4.2 Withdrawal Rules: You agree that funds in Your Account must only be used for playing the Games found on the Site. If you request a withdrawal without turning over an amount that is equal or more than the amount purchased we may require you to make a turnover of the full purchase. This will be done in line with our internal security processes and procedures. We can reject a withdrawal request if we suspect that funds are being withdrawn for any fraudulent or money laundering reasons. Prior to accepting a withdrawal we may request that you provide legal identification for example certified copies of passports, ID cards or other such documentation as we feel is required in the circumstances. We may also carry out phone verification, face verification or other such verification as is required to confirm the identity of the user. You may only withdraw the maximum amount of 2,500 Max Coins (2,500 USD) in any twenty-four hour period unless a larger amount has been agreed by us. All withdrawals must be done through the same payment method chosen by you when placing a purchase, unless we decide otherwise or are unable to do so. If you purchase using a number of payment methods, we reserve the right to split your withdrawal across such payment methods and process each part through the respective payment method at our discretion and in accordance with anti-money laundering policies and regulation. We may request that you redirect your withdrawal or cancel it or request that it is redirected to a different method of withdrawal in accordance with anti-money laundering policies and/or regulation.

Suspicious Activity is activity conducted by a user or non-user using the product, where there are indications that the persons are engaging in any form of fraudulent or illegal activity. Principles: The key principles of the “Anti-Money Laundering Statement” are that:MaxQuest will maintain a written document of AML policy and procedures and a system of internal controls to ensure ongoing AML compliance by a designated person(s) and to take appropriate action, once suspicious activity is detected. MaxQuest will comply with applicable anti-money laundering &amp; terrorist financing laws and regulations wherever possible.

It is unlawful to purchase money which has been obtained illegally, for whatever reason. We accept payments made in BTC, ETH, LTC, and USDT, which are subject to change at any time. Any payments received in a currency other than the one chosen by you could potentially be lost at your own discretion. We do not accept cash directly or cash delivered to any payment solution provider. Identity verification of a customer may be requested upon a threshold the amount of two thousand Max Coins ($2000) in withdrawals, whether such threshold was reached in a single transaction or consecutive requests within a rolling period of 90 days. Following this, an audit trail is taken into consideration upon each withdrawal request, taking purchases of customer’s packages also. We may also carry out these verification procedures even in case of lower purchases or in case of any withdrawals. We are subject to request verification from any customer at any given time, depending on our analysis of the behavior of the customer in question.  
                   4.2 Withdrawal Rules: You agree that funds in Your Account must only be used for playing the Games found on the Site. If you request a withdrawal without turning over an amount that is equal or more than the amount purchased we may require you to make a turnover of the full purchase. This will be done in line with our internal security processes and procedures. We can reject a withdrawal request if we suspect that funds are being withdrawn for any fraudulent or money laundering reasons. Prior to accepting a withdrawal we may request that you provide legal identification for example certified copies of passports, ID cards or other such documentation as we feel is required in the circumstances. We may also carry out phone verification, face verification or other such verification as is required to confirm the identity of the user. You may only withdraw the maximum amount of 2,500 Max Coins (2,500 USD) in any twenty-four hour period unless a larger amount has been agreed by us. All withdrawals must be done through the same payment method chosen by you when placing a purchase, unless we decide otherwise or are unable to do so. If you purchase using a number of payment methods, we reserve the right to split your withdrawal across such payment methods and process each part through the respective payment method at our discretion and in accordance with anti-money laundering policies and regulation. We may request that you redirect your withdrawal or cancel it or request that it is redirected to a different method of withdrawal in accordance with anti-money laundering policies and/or regulation.
