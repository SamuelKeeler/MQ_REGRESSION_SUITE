You acknowledge that you may incur a charge for these texts or calls by your cell phone carrier and that MaxQuest will not be responsible for these charges. 
                 In addition to collecting information via our Website, we collect information from Players by telephone, video or in correspondence (including Email, Live Chat, mail, text message, and/or social media). All telephone or video calls between Players and MQ Technology representatives may be recorded for training, quality control and compliance purposes. By continuing with any such call you consent to it being recorded. 
                 We also collect information about your use of our products and services through a variety of technologies that are present when you visit our Websites or use our applications on third party sites or platforms (whether or not you are logged in or registered) including cookies, flash cookies, pixels, tags and application program interfaces (&quot;API&quot;).

                 Analytics tools are also used by us to collect information, including when you visit our Website or use our applications or services on third party sites or platforms. 
                 Finally, we also use trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided, or we collected, including in order to verify or validate information (for example, postal address, documentation and names). 
                 
                4. How we use collected information 
                 
                 The Data Controller is responsible for and may use your information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Other members of MQ Technology may access your information where they act on behalf of the Data Controller as a data processor for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In summary, we use the information collected to operate our Website and to provide our products and services, to facilitate your financial transactions, to respond to your questions and to fulfill all applicable regulatory requirements such as anti-fraud checks and other checks required by applicable anti-money laundering and other legislation. 
                 In accordance with applicable law and any elections made available to you, MQ Technology may collect and use the information of Players for the following specific purposes: 
                   
                   To provide and manage the services you request. For example, processing your registration and setting up and looking after your account, including checks made to guard against fraud. 
                   To improve customer service and our services. Information you provide helps us respond to your customer service requests more efficiently. We may use feedback you provide to improve our products and services. 
                   To process payments. We may use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to service that order (including to satisfy our customer due diligence requirements and to establish the source of funds where necessary). We do not share this information with third parties except to the extent necessary to provide the service. 
                   To personalize Player experience. We may use information which has been aggregated to understand how our Players as a group use the services and resources provided on our Website. 
                   To contact you about our services. This includes Email, Live Chat, telephone, text message, mail or social media in order to manage promotions and competitions you choose to enter. We may periodically contact you with offers and information about our products and services, including in connection with your accounts, promotions, contests, online surveys, new features that you are entitled to access, and other important information. As set out in Section 3, provision of your cell phone information will be deemed as your consent to receive text messages sent by automatic dialing systems. Consent to receive direct advertising is not a condition of purchase. 
                   To send important notices to you. From time to time, we may send communications about purchases you have made, or legal notices regarding the changes to our terms and conditions or other policies. This information is important to your interactions with us and you acknowledge that you may not opt-out of receiving these communications. 
                   To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations. We may use information we collect about you to assess your social gameplay activity for responsible social gameplay purposes, for taxation purposes, to comply with fraud and anti-money laundering laws (including to establish the source of funds where a transaction is involved) or to comply with any other legal or regulatory obligations (including the detection, investigation and prevention of activity that violates our terms and conditions or that may be illegal). 
                   To offer alternative dispute resolution services. We may provide information we collect about you to our third party partner for the specific purpose of resolving any disputes that have not been satisfactorily resolved through our internal processes. 
                    
                 
                5. Personal data collection and cookies 
                 
                 When you interact with our Website, we try to make that experience simple and useful. We and our partners use industry standard identifiers, such as cookies or other similar technologies. 
                 Our Website uses Cookies and other technologies to enhance the Player experience. These are small files that are placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone or other devices when you visit a website. They allow us to record certain pieces of information, but only while you’re on our site. 
                 These are examples of Cookies and other types of technologies: 
                   
                   Cookies. These are small text files placed in your device browsers to store your preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the service may not work properly. 
                   Pixel tags/web beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Website that collects information about Players’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a Player has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on or forwarded. 
                   Mobile device identifiers. We may share the advertising identifier associated with your mobile device or tablet (such as the Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID) with advertisers. It is used to identify your device for internet-based advertising. 
                   Event tagging. Event tagging (including Facebook App Events and Playfab Events) allows us to track actions that occur in the Website such as application installs and purchase events. By tracking these events we can view analytics, measure ad performance, and build audiences for ad targeting. 
                    
                 
                6. Behavioral advertising 
                 
                 We may partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Website or any application accessible via our Website or to manage our advertising on other websites (for example, using custom audiences on Facebook). Our third-party partner may use technologies such as cookies (see Section 5) to gather information about your activities on our Website and other websites in order to provide you advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. 
                 If you wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising click here. 
                 
                7. Your rights over your information 
                 
                 We appreciate that by law and subject to certain conditions, you have a number of rights concerning the personal information we hold about you. These rights include the right to access the personal information we hold about you, the right to object to the processing of your data and the right to withdraw any consent provided. In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete the personal information we hold about you. 
                 To exercise the rights described in Section 7(a), please complete the MaxQuest contact form here or alternatively Email. 
                 
                8. Right to complain to a supervisory authority 
                 
                 You also have the right to complain to the relevant data protection supervisory authority about our processing of your personally identifiable information. 
                 
                9. Rights in direct advertising 
                 
                 If we process your personally identifiable information for the purpose of direct advertising, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personally identifiable information relating to you for the purpose of such advertising. This also applies to profiling, where appropriate, insofar as it is associated with such direct advertising. 
                 You may opt-out of receiving commercial messages from us by following the instructions contained in those messages or by contacting Customer Support. In the event of your objection to processing for the purpose of direct advertising, we will no longer process your personally identifiable information for these purposes. 
                 
                10. How we protect your information 
                 
                 We have physical, electronic and operational procedures in place to protect the information that we collect. We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, Playername, password, transaction information and data stored on our Website. Our security measures are reviewed regularly and updated in keeping with technological advances. 
                 
                11. How long will we retain your information 
                 
                 We will retain your information for the period of time required to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. 
                 
                12. Sharing your information 
                 
                 We do not sell, trade, or rent the personal identification information of Players to others. However, there are circumstances when we share your personal data with third parties that provide services to you on our behalf, and with other third parties in the course of complying with our legal obligations. 
                 
                13. Third parties 
                 
                 We only share information with third parties in limited circumstances including the following: 
                   
                   when you allow us to share your information with third parties; 
                   when providing you with products and services and notifying you about either important changes or developments to the features and operation of those products and services; 
                   with our service providers to enable us to provide our services, such as companies that help us with technology services, storing and combining data, processing payments and redemptions or providing relevant marketing and advertising for our products and services. The partner companies will have access to your personal information only to perform services on our behalf and are prohibited from using your personal information for purposes other than those requested by us or required by law. Where service providers use personal information for their own purposes, where permitted by law, such service providers will act as data controller; 
                   in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, when ordered to do so by any regulatory body and/or under any legal provision contained in the governing law of a particular jurisdiction; 
                   when instructing and authorizing the financial institution with which a Player’s account is held to disclose any information as may be requested by a regulator in respect of the Player’s account; 
                   to enforce our terms and conditions set out on our Website, to protect our rights and property and the rights and property of our Players and third parties, to detect fraud or other illegal activities, and to comply with law or legal processes; and 
                   to perform customer due diligence including ID verification. 
                    
                 We may ask you to provide your image to assist us in verifying your identity. We do this by using facial recognition technology provided by third parties. 
                 We may also share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors to and Players of our with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above. 
                 
                14. Transfers 
                 
                 MQ Technology operates in several local and international jurisdictions. Personal information we collect may be transferred to, and stored and processed by, third parties in the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, the Philippines or any other country in which we or our third party processors maintain facilities. We will ensure that transfers of personal information to any country or organization are subject to appropriate safeguards. 
                 
                15. Other important information 
                 
                 Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information on our Website from individuals we actually know are under the age of 18, and no part of our Website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 18. 
                 
                16. Do-not-track signals and other mechanisms 
                 
                 Some web browsers may transmit &quot;do-not-track&quot; signals to the websites with which the Player communicates. Due to the different ways that web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether Players intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they are even aware of them. As there is currently no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, our Website currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. 
                 
                17. Changes to this privacy policy 
                 
                 This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the way we work or the way our work is regulated. We will notify you of material changes and, where required by law, will obtain your consent. Notice may be by the posting of such changes on our Website or by other means in accordance with applicable law. 
                 Any changes to the Privacy Policy will become effective when the updated policy is posted on our Website. 
                 We encourage Players to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. 
                 
                18. Definitions 
                 
                 Personal information means information that identifies (whether directly or indirectly) a particular individual, such as the individual’s name, postal address, Email address, and telephone number. When anonymous information is directly or indirectly associated with personal information, the resulting information is also treated as personal information. 
                 Anonymous information means information that does not directly or indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual. 
                 Aggregate information means information about groups or categories of customers, which does not identify and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual customer. 
                 
                19. Contacting us 
                 
                 If you have specific questions regarding your personal information or how we use it, contact us directly by Email on support@maxquest.com.

                4. How we use collected information 
                 
                 The Data Controller is responsible for and may use your information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Other members of MQ Technology may access your information where they act on behalf of the Data Controller as a data processor for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In summary, we use the information collected to operate our Website and to provide our products and services, to facilitate your financial transactions, to respond to your questions and to fulfill all applicable regulatory requirements such as anti-fraud checks and other checks required by applicable anti-money laundering and other legislation. 
                 In accordance with applicable law and any elections made available to you, MQ Technology may collect and use the information of Players for the following specific purposes: 
                   
                   To provide and manage the services you request. For example, processing your registration and setting up and looking after your account, including checks made to guard against fraud. 
                   To improve customer service and our services. Information you provide helps us respond to your customer service requests more efficiently. We may use feedback you provide to improve our products and services. 
                   To process payments. We may use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to service that order (including to satisfy our customer due diligence requirements and to establish the source of funds where necessary). We do not share this information with third parties except to the extent necessary to provide the service. 
                   To personalize Player experience. We may use information which has been aggregated to understand how our Players as a group use the services and resources provided on our Website. 
                   To contact you about our services. This includes Email, Live Chat, telephone, text message, mail or social media in order to manage promotions and competitions you choose to enter. We may periodically contact you with offers and information about our products and services, including in connection with your accounts, promotions, contests, online surveys, new features that you are entitled to access, and other important information. As set out in Section 3, provision of your cell phone information will be deemed as your consent to receive text messages sent by automatic dialing systems. Consent to receive direct advertising is not a condition of purchase. 
                   To send important notices to you. From time to time, we may send communications about purchases you have made, or legal notices regarding the changes to our terms and conditions or other policies. This information is important to your interactions with us and you acknowledge that you may not opt-out of receiving these communications. 
                   To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations. We may use information we collect about you to assess your social gameplay activity for responsible social gameplay purposes, for taxation purposes, to comply with fraud and anti-money laundering laws (including to establish the source of funds where a transaction is involved) or to comply with any other legal or regulatory obligations (including the detection, investigation and prevention of activity that violates our terms and conditions or that may be illegal). 
                   To offer alternative dispute resolution services. We may provide information we collect about you to our third party partner for the specific purpose of resolving any disputes that have not been satisfactorily resolved through our internal processes. 
                    
                 
                5. Personal data collection and cookies 
                 
                 When you interact with our Website, we try to make that experience simple and useful. We and our partners use industry standard identifiers, such as cookies or other similar technologies. 
                 Our Website uses Cookies and other technologies to enhance the Player experience. These are small files that are placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone or other devices when you visit a website. They allow us to record certain pieces of information, but only while you’re on our site. 
                 These are examples of Cookies and other types of technologies: 
                   
                   Cookies. These are small text files placed in your device browsers to store your preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the service may not work properly. 
                   Pixel tags/web beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Website that collects information about Players’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a Player has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on or forwarded. 
                   Mobile device identifiers. We may share the advertising identifier associated with your mobile device or tablet (such as the Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID) with advertisers. It is used to identify your device for internet-based advertising. 
                   Event tagging. Event tagging (including Facebook App Events and Playfab Events) allows us to track actions that occur in the Website such as application installs and purchase events. By tracking these events we can view analytics, measure ad performance, and build audiences for ad targeting. 
                    
                 
                6. Behavioral advertising 
                 
                 We may partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Website or any application accessible via our Website or to manage our advertising on other websites (for example, using custom audiences on Facebook). Our third-party partner may use technologies such as cookies (see Section 5) to gather information about your activities on our Website and other websites in order to provide you advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. 
                 If you wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising click here. 
                 
                7. Your rights over your information 
                 
                 We appreciate that by law and subject to certain conditions, you have a number of rights concerning the personal information we hold about you. These rights include the right to access the personal information we hold about you, the right to object to the processing of your data and the right to withdraw any consent provided. In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete the personal information we hold about you.

                8. Right to complain to a supervisory authority 
                 
                 You also have the right to complain to the relevant data protection supervisory authority about our processing of your personally identifiable information. 
                 
                9. Rights in direct advertising 
                 
                 If we process your personally identifiable information for the purpose of direct advertising, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personally identifiable information relating to you for the purpose of such advertising. This also applies to profiling, where appropriate, insofar as it is associated with such direct advertising. 
                 You may opt-out of receiving commercial messages from us by following the instructions contained in those messages or by contacting Customer Support. In the event of your objection to processing for the purpose of direct advertising, we will no longer process your personally identifiable information for these purposes. 
                 
                10. How we protect your information 
                 
                 We have physical, electronic and operational procedures in place to protect the information that we collect. We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, Playername, password, transaction information and data stored on our Website. Our security measures are reviewed regularly and updated in keeping with technological advances. 
                 
                11. How long will we retain your information 
                 
                 We will retain your information for the period of time required to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. 
                 
                12. Sharing your information 
                 
                 We do not sell, trade, or rent the personal identification information of Players to others. However, there are circumstances when we share your personal data with third parties that provide services to you on our behalf, and with other third parties in the course of complying with our legal obligations. 
                 
                13. Third parties 
                 
                 We only share information with third parties in limited circumstances including the following: 
                   
                   when you allow us to share your information with third parties; 
                   when providing you with products and services and notifying you about either important changes or developments to the features and operation of those products and services; 
                   with our service providers to enable us to provide our services, such as companies that help us with technology services, storing and combining data, processing payments and redemptions or providing relevant marketing and advertising for our products and services. The partner companies will have access to your personal information only to perform services on our behalf and are prohibited from using your personal information for purposes other than those requested by us or required by law. Where service providers use personal information for their own purposes, where permitted by law, such service providers will act as data controller; 
                   in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, when ordered to do so by any regulatory body and/or under any legal provision contained in the governing law of a particular jurisdiction; 
                   when instructing and authorizing the financial institution with which a Player’s account is held to disclose any information as may be requested by a regulator in respect of the Player’s account; 
                   to enforce our terms and conditions set out on our Website, to protect our rights and property and the rights and property of our Players and third parties, to detect fraud or other illegal activities, and to comply with law or legal processes; and 
                   to perform customer due diligence including ID verification. 
                    
                 We may ask you to provide your image to assist us in verifying your identity. We do this by using facial recognition technology provided by third parties. 
                 We may also share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors to and Players of our with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above. 
                 
                14. Transfers 
                 
                 MQ Technology operates in several local and international jurisdictions. Personal information we collect may be transferred to, and stored and processed by, third parties in the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, the Philippines or any other country in which we or our third party processors maintain facilities. We will ensure that transfers of personal information to any country or organization are subject to appropriate safeguards. 
                 
                15. Other important information 
                 
                 Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information on our Website from individuals we actually know are under the age of 18, and no part of our Website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 18. 
                 
                16. Do-not-track signals and other mechanisms 
                 
                 Some web browsers may transmit &quot;do-not-track&quot; signals to the websites with which the Player communicates. Due to the different ways that web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether Players intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they are even aware of them. As there is currently no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, our Website currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. 
                 
                17. Changes to this privacy policy 
                 
                 This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the way we work or the way our work is regulated. We will notify you of material changes and, where required by law, will obtain your consent. Notice may be by the posting of such changes on our Website or by other means in accordance with applicable law. 
                 Any changes to the Privacy Policy will become effective when the updated policy is posted on our Website. 
                 We encourage Players to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. 
                 
                18. Definitions 
                 
                 Personal information means information that identifies (whether directly or indirectly) a particular individual, such as the individual’s name, postal address, Email address, and telephone number. When anonymous information is directly or indirectly associated with personal information, the resulting information is also treated as personal information. 
                 Anonymous information means information that does not directly or indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual. 
                 Aggregate information means information about groups or categories of customers, which does not identify and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual customer. 
                 
                19. Contacting us 
                 
                 If you have specific questions regarding your personal information or how we use it, contact us directly by Email on support@maxquest.com. Please specify your place of residence and the nature of your question.

                4. How we use collected information 
                 
                 The Data Controller is responsible for and may use your information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Other members of MQ Technology may access your information where they act on behalf of the Data Controller as a data processor for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In summary, we use the information collected to operate our Website and to provide our products and services, to facilitate your financial transactions, to respond to your questions and to fulfill all applicable regulatory requirements such as anti-fraud checks and other checks required by applicable anti-money laundering and other legislation. 
                 In accordance with applicable law and any elections made available to you, MQ Technology may collect and use the information of Players for the following specific purposes: 
                   
                   To provide and manage the services you request. For example, processing your registration and setting up and looking after your account, including checks made to guard against fraud. 
                   To improve customer service and our services. Information you provide helps us respond to your customer service requests more efficiently. We may use feedback you provide to improve our products and services. 
                   To process payments. We may use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to service that order (including to satisfy our customer due diligence requirements and to establish the source of funds where necessary). We do not share this information with third parties except to the extent necessary to provide the service. 
                   To personalize Player experience. We may use information which has been aggregated to understand how our Players as a group use the services and resources provided on our Website. 
                   To contact you about our services. This includes Email, Live Chat, telephone, text message, mail or social media in order to manage promotions and competitions you choose to enter. We may periodically contact you with offers and information about our products and services, including in connection with your accounts, promotions, contests, online surveys, new features that you are entitled to access, and other important information. As set out in Section 3, provision of your cell phone information will be deemed as your consent to receive text messages sent by automatic dialing systems. Consent to receive direct advertising is not a condition of purchase. 
                   To send important notices to you. From time to time, we may send communications about purchases you have made, or legal notices regarding the changes to our terms and conditions or other policies. This information is important to your interactions with us and you acknowledge that you may not opt-out of receiving these communications.

                   To offer alternative dispute resolution services. We may provide information we collect about you to our third party partner for the specific purpose of resolving any disputes that have not been satisfactorily resolved through our internal processes. 
                    
                 
                5. Personal data collection and cookies 
                 
                 When you interact with our Website, we try to make that experience simple and useful. We and our partners use industry standard identifiers, such as cookies or other similar technologies. 
                 Our Website uses Cookies and other technologies to enhance the Player experience. These are small files that are placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone or other devices when you visit a website. They allow us to record certain pieces of information, but only while you’re on our site. 
                 These are examples of Cookies and other types of technologies: 
                   
                   Cookies. These are small text files placed in your device browsers to store your preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the service may not work properly. 
                   Pixel tags/web beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Website that collects information about Players’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a Player has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on or forwarded. 
                   Mobile device identifiers. We may share the advertising identifier associated with your mobile device or tablet (such as the Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID) with advertisers. It is used to identify your device for internet-based advertising. 
                   Event tagging. Event tagging (including Facebook App Events and Playfab Events) allows us to track actions that occur in the Website such as application installs and purchase events. By tracking these events we can view analytics, measure ad performance, and build audiences for ad targeting. 
                    
                 
                6. Behavioral advertising 
                 
                 We may partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Website or any application accessible via our Website or to manage our advertising on other websites (for example, using custom audiences on Facebook). Our third-party partner may use technologies such as cookies (see Section 5) to gather information about your activities on our Website and other websites in order to provide you advertising based on your browsing activities and interests.

                7. Your rights over your information 
                 
                 We appreciate that by law and subject to certain conditions, you have a number of rights concerning the personal information we hold about you. These rights include the right to access the personal information we hold about you, the right to object to the processing of your data and the right to withdraw any consent provided. In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete the personal information we hold about you.

                8. Right to complain to a supervisory authority 
                 
                 You also have the right to complain to the relevant data protection supervisory authority about our processing of your personally identifiable information. 
                 
                9. Rights in direct advertising 
                 
                 If we process your personally identifiable information for the purpose of direct advertising, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personally identifiable information relating to you for the purpose of such advertising. This also applies to profiling, where appropriate, insofar as it is associated with such direct advertising. 
                 You may opt-out of receiving commercial messages from us by following the instructions contained in those messages or by contacting Customer Support. In the event of your objection to processing for the purpose of direct advertising, we will no longer process your personally identifiable information for these purposes. 
                 
                10. How we protect your information 
                 
                 We have physical, electronic and operational procedures in place to protect the information that we collect. We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, Playername, password, transaction information and data stored on our Website. Our security measures are reviewed regularly and updated in keeping with technological advances. 
                 
                11. How long will we retain your information 
                 
                 We will retain your information for the period of time required to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. 
                 
                12. Sharing your information 
                 
                 We do not sell, trade, or rent the personal identification information of Players to others. However, there are circumstances when we share your personal data with third parties that provide services to you on our behalf, and with other third parties in the course of complying with our legal obligations. 
                 
                13. Third parties 
                 
                 We only share information with third parties in limited circumstances including the following: 
                   
                   when you allow us to share your information with third parties; 
                   when providing you with products and services and notifying you about either important changes or developments to the features and operation of those products and services; 
                   with our service providers to enable us to provide our services, such as companies that help us with technology services, storing and combining data, processing payments and redemptions or providing relevant marketing and advertising for our products and services. The partner companies will have access to your personal information only to perform services on our behalf and are prohibited from using your personal information for purposes other than those requested by us or required by law. Where service providers use personal information for their own purposes, where permitted by law, such service providers will act as data controller; 
                   in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, when ordered to do so by any regulatory body and/or under any legal provision contained in the governing law of a particular jurisdiction; 
                   when instructing and authorizing the financial institution with which a Player’s account is held to disclose any information as may be requested by a regulator in respect of the Player’s account; 
                   to enforce our terms and conditions set out on our Website, to protect our rights and property and the rights and property of our Players and third parties, to detect fraud or other illegal activities, and to comply with law or legal processes; and 
                   to perform customer due diligence including ID verification. 
                    
                 We may ask you to provide your image to assist us in verifying your identity. We do this by using facial recognition technology provided by third parties. 
                 We may also share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors to and Players of our with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above. 
                 
                14. Transfers 
                 
                 MQ Technology operates in several local and international jurisdictions. Personal information we collect may be transferred to, and stored and processed by, third parties in the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, the Philippines or any other country in which we or our third party processors maintain facilities. We will ensure that transfers of personal information to any country or organization are subject to appropriate safeguards. 
                 
                15. Other important information 
                 
                 Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information on our Website from individuals we actually know are under the age of 18, and no part of our Website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 18. 
                 
                16. Do-not-track signals and other mechanisms 
                 
                 Some web browsers may transmit &quot;do-not-track&quot; signals to the websites with which the Player communicates. Due to the different ways that web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether Players intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they are even aware of them. As there is currently no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, our Website currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. 
                 
                17. Changes to this privacy policy 
                 
                 This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the way we work or the way our work is regulated. We will notify you of material changes and, where required by law, will obtain your consent. Notice may be by the posting of such changes on our Website or by other means in accordance with applicable law. 
                 Any changes to the Privacy Policy will become effective when the updated policy is posted on our Website. 
                 We encourage Players to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. 
                 
                18. Definitions 
                 
                 Personal information means information that identifies (whether directly or indirectly) a particular individual, such as the individual’s name, postal address, Email address, and telephone number. When anonymous information is directly or indirectly associated with personal information, the resulting information is also treated as personal information. 
                 Anonymous information means information that does not directly or indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual. 
                 Aggregate information means information about groups or categories of customers, which does not identify and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual customer.

As set out in Section 3, provision of your cell phone information will be deemed as your consent to receive text messages sent by automatic dialing systems. Consent to receive direct advertising is not a condition of purchase.

From time to time, we may send communications about purchases you have made, or legal notices regarding the changes to our terms and conditions or other policies.

                5. Personal data collection and cookies 
                 
                 When you interact with our Website, we try to make that experience simple and useful. We and our partners use industry standard identifiers, such as cookies or other similar technologies. 
                 Our Website uses Cookies and other technologies to enhance the Player experience. These are small files that are placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone or other devices when you visit a website. They allow us to record certain pieces of information, but only while you’re on our site. 
                 These are examples of Cookies and other types of technologies: 
                   
                   Cookies. These are small text files placed in your device browsers to store your preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the service may not work properly. 
                   Pixel tags/web beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Website that collects information about Players’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a Player has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on or forwarded. 
                   Mobile device identifiers. We may share the advertising identifier associated with your mobile device or tablet (such as the Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID) with advertisers. It is used to identify your device for internet-based advertising. 
                   Event tagging. Event tagging (including Facebook App Events and Playfab Events) allows us to track actions that occur in the Website such as application installs and purchase events. By tracking these events we can view analytics, measure ad performance, and build audiences for ad targeting. 
                    
                 
                6. Behavioral advertising 
                 
                 We may partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Website or any application accessible via our Website or to manage our advertising on other websites (for example, using custom audiences on Facebook). Our third-party partner may use technologies such as cookies (see Section 5) to gather information about your activities on our Website and other websites in order to provide you advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. 
                 If you wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising click here. 
                 
                7. Your rights over your information 
                 
                 We appreciate that by law and subject to certain conditions, you have a number of rights concerning the personal information we hold about you. These rights include the right to access the personal information we hold about you, the right to object to the processing of your data and the right to withdraw any consent provided.

                8. Right to complain to a supervisory authority 
                 
                 You also have the right to complain to the relevant data protection supervisory authority about our processing of your personally identifiable information. 
                 
                9. Rights in direct advertising 
                 
                 If we process your personally identifiable information for the purpose of direct advertising, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personally identifiable information relating to you for the purpose of such advertising. This also applies to profiling, where appropriate, insofar as it is associated with such direct advertising. 
                 You may opt-out of receiving commercial messages from us by following the instructions contained in those messages or by contacting Customer Support. In the event of your objection to processing for the purpose of direct advertising, we will no longer process your personally identifiable information for these purposes. 
                 
                10. How we protect your information 
                 
                 We have physical, electronic and operational procedures in place to protect the information that we collect. We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, Playername, password, transaction information and data stored on our Website. Our security measures are reviewed regularly and updated in keeping with technological advances. 
                 
                11. How long will we retain your information 
                 
                 We will retain your information for the period of time required to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. 
                 
                12. Sharing your information 
                 
                 We do not sell, trade, or rent the personal identification information of Players to others. However, there are circumstances when we share your personal data with third parties that provide services to you on our behalf, and with other third parties in the course of complying with our legal obligations. 
                 
                13. Third parties 
                 
                 We only share information with third parties in limited circumstances including the following: 
                   
                   when you allow us to share your information with third parties; 
                   when providing you with products and services and notifying you about either important changes or developments to the features and operation of those products and services; 
                   with our service providers to enable us to provide our services, such as companies that help us with technology services, storing and combining data, processing payments and redemptions or providing relevant marketing and advertising for our products and services. The partner companies will have access to your personal information only to perform services on our behalf and are prohibited from using your personal information for purposes other than those requested by us or required by law. Where service providers use personal information for their own purposes, where permitted by law, such service providers will act as data controller; 
                   in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, when ordered to do so by any regulatory body and/or under any legal provision contained in the governing law of a particular jurisdiction; 
                   when instructing and authorizing the financial institution with which a Player’s account is held to disclose any information as may be requested by a regulator in respect of the Player’s account; 
                   to enforce our terms and conditions set out on our Website, to protect our rights and property and the rights and property of our Players and third parties, to detect fraud or other illegal activities, and to comply with law or legal processes; and 
                   to perform customer due diligence including ID verification. 
                    
                 We may ask you to provide your image to assist us in verifying your identity. We do this by using facial recognition technology provided by third parties. 
                 We may also share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors to and Players of our with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above. 
                 
                14. Transfers 
                 
                 MQ Technology operates in several local and international jurisdictions. Personal information we collect may be transferred to, and stored and processed by, third parties in the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, the Philippines or any other country in which we or our third party processors maintain facilities. We will ensure that transfers of personal information to any country or organization are subject to appropriate safeguards. 
                 
                15. Other important information 
                 
                 Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information on our Website from individuals we actually know are under the age of 18, and no part of our Website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 18. 
                 
                16. Do-not-track signals and other mechanisms 
                 
                 Some web browsers may transmit &quot;do-not-track&quot; signals to the websites with which the Player communicates. Due to the different ways that web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether Players intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they are even aware of them. As there is currently no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, our Website currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. 
                 
                17. Changes to this privacy policy 
                 
                 This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the way we work or the way our work is regulated. We will notify you of material changes and, where required by law, will obtain your consent. Notice may be by the posting of such changes on our Website or by other means in accordance with applicable law. 
                 Any changes to the Privacy Policy will become effective when the updated policy is posted on our Website. 
                 We encourage Players to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. 
                 
                18. Definitions 
                 
                 Personal information means information that identifies (whether directly or indirectly) a particular individual, such as the individual’s name, postal address, Email address, and telephone number. When anonymous information is directly or indirectly associated with personal information, the resulting information is also treated as personal information. 
                 Anonymous information means information that does not directly or indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual. 
                 Aggregate information means information about groups or categories of customers, which does not identify and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual customer.

                   To improve customer service and our services. Information you provide helps us respond to your customer service requests more efficiently. We may use feedback you provide to improve our products and services. 
                   To process payments. We may use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to service that order (including to satisfy our customer due diligence requirements and to establish the source of funds where necessary). We do not share this information with third parties except to the extent necessary to provide the service. 
                   To personalize Player experience. We may use information which has been aggregated to understand how our Players as a group use the services and resources provided on our Website. 
                   To contact you about our services. This includes Email, Live Chat, telephone, text message, mail or social media in order to manage promotions and competitions you choose to enter. We may periodically contact you with offers and information about our products and services, including in connection with your accounts, promotions, contests, online surveys, new features that you are entitled to access, and other important information. As set out in Section 3, provision of your cell phone information will be deemed as your consent to receive text messages sent by automatic dialing systems. Consent to receive direct advertising is not a condition of purchase. 
                   To send important notices to you. From time to time, we may send communications about purchases you have made, or legal notices regarding the changes to our terms and conditions or other policies. This information is important to your interactions with us and you acknowledge that you may not opt-out of receiving these communications.

                   To offer alternative dispute resolution services. We may provide information we collect about you to our third party partner for the specific purpose of resolving any disputes that have not been satisfactorily resolved through our internal processes. 
                    
                 
                5. Personal data collection and cookies 
                 
                 When you interact with our Website, we try to make that experience simple and useful. We and our partners use industry standard identifiers, such as cookies or other similar technologies. 
                 Our Website uses Cookies and other technologies to enhance the Player experience. These are small files that are placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone or other devices when you visit a website. They allow us to record certain pieces of information, but only while you’re on our site. 
                 These are examples of Cookies and other types of technologies: 
                   
                   Cookies. These are small text files placed in your device browsers to store your preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the service may not work properly. 
                   Pixel tags/web beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Website that collects information about Players’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a Player has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on or forwarded. 
                   Mobile device identifiers. We may share the advertising identifier associated with your mobile device or tablet (such as the Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID) with advertisers. It is used to identify your device for internet-based advertising. 
                   Event tagging. Event tagging (including Facebook App Events and Playfab Events) allows us to track actions that occur in the Website such as application installs and purchase events. By tracking these events we can view analytics, measure ad performance, and build audiences for ad targeting.

                 We have physical, electronic and operational procedures in place to protect the information that we collect.

                12. Sharing your information 
                 
                 We do not sell, trade, or rent the personal identification information of Players to others. However, there are circumstances when we share your personal data with third parties that provide services to you on our behalf, and with other third parties in the course of complying with our legal obligations. 
                 
                13. Third parties 
                 
                 We only share information with third parties in limited circumstances including the following: 
                   
                   when you allow us to share your information with third parties; 
                   when providing you with products and services and notifying you about either important changes or developments to the features and operation of those products and services; 
                   with our service providers to enable us to provide our services, such as companies that help us with technology services, storing and combining data, processing payments and redemptions or providing relevant marketing and advertising for our products and services. The partner companies will have access to your personal information only to perform services on our behalf and are prohibited from using your personal information for purposes other than those requested by us or required by law. Where service providers use personal information for their own purposes, where permitted by law, such service providers will act as data controller; 
                   in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, when ordered to do so by any regulatory body and/or under any legal provision contained in the governing law of a particular jurisdiction; 
                   when instructing and authorizing the financial institution with which a Player’s account is held to disclose any information as may be requested by a regulator in respect of the Player’s account; 
                   to enforce our terms and conditions set out on our Website, to protect our rights and property and the rights and property of our Players and third parties, to detect fraud or other illegal activities, and to comply with law or legal processes; and 
                   to perform customer due diligence including ID verification. 
                    
                 We may ask you to provide your image to assist us in verifying your identity. We do this by using facial recognition technology provided by third parties. 
                 We may also share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors to and Players of our with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above. 
                 
                14. Transfers 
                 
                 MQ Technology operates in several local and international jurisdictions. Personal information we collect may be transferred to, and stored and processed by, third parties in the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, the Philippines or any other country in which we or our third party processors maintain facilities. We will ensure that transfers of personal information to any country or organization are subject to appropriate safeguards. 
                 
                15. Other important information 
                 
                 Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information on our Website from individuals we actually know are under the age of 18, and no part of our Website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 18. 
                 
                16. Do-not-track signals and other mechanisms 
                 
                 Some web browsers may transmit &quot;do-not-track&quot; signals to the websites with which the Player communicates. Due to the different ways that web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether Players intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they are even aware of them. As there is currently no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, our Website currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. 
                 
                17. Changes to this privacy policy 
                 
                 This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the way we work or the way our work is regulated. We will notify you of material changes and, where required by law, will obtain your consent. Notice may be by the posting of such changes on our Website or by other means in accordance with applicable law. 
                 Any changes to the Privacy Policy will become effective when the updated policy is posted on our Website. 
                 We encourage Players to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. 
                 
                18. Definitions 
                 
                 Personal information means information that identifies (whether directly or indirectly) a particular individual, such as the individual’s name, postal address, Email address, and telephone number. When anonymous information is directly or indirectly associated with personal information, the resulting information is also treated as personal information. 
                 Anonymous information means information that does not directly or indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual. 
                 Aggregate information means information about groups or categories of customers, which does not identify and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual customer.

                 Our Website uses Cookies and other technologies to enhance the Player experience. These are small files that are placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone or other devices when you visit a website. They allow us to record certain pieces of information, but only while you’re on our site. 
                 These are examples of Cookies and other types of technologies: 
                   
                   Cookies. These are small text files placed in your device browsers to store your preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the service may not work properly. 
                   Pixel tags/web beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Website that collects information about Players’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a Player has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on or forwarded. 
                   Mobile device identifiers. We may share the advertising identifier associated with your mobile device or tablet (such as the Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID) with advertisers. It is used to identify your device for internet-based advertising. 
                   Event tagging. Event tagging (including Facebook App Events and Playfab Events) allows us to track actions that occur in the Website such as application installs and purchase events. By tracking these events we can view analytics, measure ad performance, and build audiences for ad targeting.

                15. Other important information 
                 
                 Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information on our Website from individuals we actually know are under the age of 18, and no part of our Website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 18. 
                 
                16. Do-not-track signals and other mechanisms 
                 
                 Some web browsers may transmit &quot;do-not-track&quot; signals to the websites with which the Player communicates. Due to the different ways that web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether Players intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they are even aware of them. As there is currently no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, our Website currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.
