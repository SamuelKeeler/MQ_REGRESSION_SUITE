      How to play
      Compete in a room made up of 2 to 6 players to defeat Enemies! Each round lasts 90 seconds, with the
        entire prize pot going to the player with the highest score. Increase your score by firing bullets at the
        Enemies.
      Point the mouse cursor at the target and left-click, or tap the targets on screen to fire a bullet. If
        your shot doesn't hit your target, it will bounce off the edges of the screen until it hits another Enemy.
      
      How to win
      You need to score the highest in the round to win the pot. Your score is increased by shooting and
        killing Enemies. You can track your position on the scoreboard on the left side of the screen. In the
        event of a tie, the pot will be split between the tied players, minus the seating fee.
      Targets
      The stronger the opponent, the more Hit Points (HP) it takes to defeat them.
      Regular Enemies will cross your screen at all times. But some Enemies are rare and will
        show up less often, and offer bigger point potential.
      Specter Enemies can explode after defeat, harming nearby enemies. Summoning the
          Dragon is the main event. You do this when players collectively gahter all 8 fragments of the
        legendary Dragonstone through Enemy drops.
      When the Dragon is defeated, the spoils are split between all players who scored. A 2x multiplier on the
        Dragon's payout is awarded to the player who has the highest score when the Dragon is defeated. If not
        defeated, the Dragon will eventually fly away and can be re-summoned when all 8 fragments are collected
        once more.
      
        Regular Enemies: 15 - 3,500 HP
        Specter Enemies: 400 - 500 HP
        The Dragon: 2,500 - 7,000 HP
      
      Weapons
      You have unlimited shots with the base Level 1 Turret weapon. Enemies can drop Powerups, which increase
        the weapon Level and award 20 shots. You can collect Powerups up to Level 3. When upgrading from level 2
        to level 3, any unused level 2 shots are converted to Level 3 shots. Any further Powerups will be
        converted into more shots at Level 3.
      All Enemies, except for the Dragon, can drop Special Weapons when they're defeated.
        These are more powerful and most effective when used against strong Enemies or groups of Enemies. Special
        Weapons are used as soon as they are won. If multiple Special Weapons are won, they will be used in the
        order in which they were obtained.
      Special features
      Critical Hits can be engaged when firing a Special Weapon. They can affect any Enemy
        except the Dragon and the Specter Enemies. Critical Hits apply a multiplier to the amount won from the
        shot fired.
      The 3-reel Mini-Slot can be activated by any Level 1 Turret shots at all Enemies except
        the Dragon. You'll win 3 spins and get prizes of 3 of a kind wins.

      The stronger the opponent, the more Hit Points (HP) it takes to defeat them.
      Regular Enemies will cross your screen at all times. But some Enemies are rare and will show up less
        often, and offer bigger point potential.
      Everytime an Enemy is destroyed, you could trigger the appearance of 1 of the 3 Legendary Bosses. Their
        appearance activates Special Weapons to help you do additional damage.
      The Bosses will periodically award prizes as they're hit. If completely defeated, they'll award a big win
        as well as 1 of 5 Rare Gems. Collect all 5 during the game for an instant prize!
      
        Regular Enemies: 30 - 1,500 HP
        Legendary Bosses: 1,000 - 5,000 HP
      
      Weapons
      You have unlimited shots with the base Level 1 Pistol. Enemies can drop Powerups, which increase the
        weapon Level and award 20 shots. You can collect Powerups up to Level 3. When upgrading from level 2 to
        level 3, any unused level 2 shots are converted to Level 3 shots. Any further Powerups will be converted
        into more shots at Level 3.
      All Enemies can drop Special Weapons when they're defeated. These are more powerful and
        most effective when used against strong Enemies or groups of Enemies. Special Weapons are used as soon as
        they are won. If multiple Special Weapons are won, they will be used in the order in which they were
        obtained.
      Special features
      Critical Hits can be engaged when firing any Weapon, but Special Weapons offer a greater
        chance. They can affect any Enemy. Critical Hits apply a multiplier to the amount won from the shot fired.
      
      Instant Wins can instantly destroy any enemy (except for the Legendary bosses, Armed
        Warriors, Exploding Toads and Spirit Scorpions) if its HP is low enough.
      Bonus Wins are awarded if an enemyâ€™s HP is low enough, and your shot does more.

        legendary Dragonstone through Enemy drops.
      When the Dragon is defeated, the spoils are split between all players who scored. A 2x multiplier on the
        Dragon&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;s payout is awarded to the player who has the highest score when the Dragon is defeated. If not
        defeated, the Dragon will eventually fly away and can be re-summoned when all 8 fragments are collected
        once more.
      
        Regular Enemies: 15 - 3,500 HP
        Specter Enemies: 400 - 500 HP
        The Dragon: 2,500 - 7,000 HP
      
      Weapons
      You have unlimited shots with the base Level 1 Turret weapon. Enemies can drop Powerups, which increase
        the weapon Level and award 20 shots. You can collect Powerups up to Level 3. When upgrading from level 2
        to level 3, any unused level 2 shots are converted to Level 3 shots. Any further Powerups will be
        converted into more shots at Level 3.
      All Enemies, except for the Dragon, can drop Special Weapons when they&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;re defeated.
        These are more powerful and most effective when used against strong Enemies or groups of Enemies. Special
        Weapons are used as soon as they are won. If multiple Special Weapons are won, they will be used in the
        order in which they were obtained.
      Special features
      Critical Hits can be engaged when firing a Special Weapon. They can affect any Enemy
        except the Dragon and the Specter Enemies. Critical Hits apply a multiplier to the amount won from the
        shot fired.
      The 3-reel Mini-Slot can be activated by any Level 1 Turret shots at all Enemies except
        the Dragon. You&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;ll win 3 spins and get prizes of 3 of a kind wins.

      How to play
      Compete in a room made up of 2 to 6 players to defeat Enemies! Each round lasts 90 seconds, with the
        entire prize pot going to the player with the highest score. Increase your score by firing bullets at the
        Enemies.
      Point the mouse cursor at the target and left-click, or tap the targets on screen to fire a bullet. If
        your shot doesn&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;t hit your target, it will bounce off the edges of the screen until it hits another Enemy.
      
      How to win
      You need to score the highest in the round to win the pot. Your score is increased by shooting and
        killing Enemies. You can track your position on the scoreboard on the left side of the screen. In the
        event of a tie, the pot will be split between the tied players, minus the seating fee.
      Targets
      The stronger the opponent, the more Hit Points (HP) it takes to defeat them.
      Regular Enemies will cross your screen at all times. But some Enemies are rare and will show up less
        often, and offer bigger point potential.
      Everytime an Enemy is destroyed, you could trigger the appearance of 1 of the 3 Legendary Bosses. Their
        appearance activates Special Weapons to help you do additional damage.
      The Bosses will periodically award prizes as they&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;re hit. If completely defeated, they&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;ll award a big win
        as well as 1 of 5 Rare Gems. Collect all 5 during the game for an instant prize!
      
        Regular Enemies: 30 - 1,500 HP
        Legendary Bosses: 1,000 - 5,000 HP
      
      Weapons
      You have unlimited shots with the base Level 1 Pistol. Enemies can drop Powerups, which increase the
        weapon Level and award 20 shots. You can collect Powerups up to Level 3. When upgrading from level 2 to
        level 3, any unused level 2 shots are converted to Level 3 shots. Any further Powerups will be converted
        into more shots at Level 3.

        they are won. If multiple Special Weapons are won, they will be used in the order in which they were
        obtained.
      Special features
      Critical Hits can be engaged when firing any Weapon, but Special Weapons offer a greater
        chance. They can affect any Enemy. Critical Hits apply a multiplier to the amount won from the shot fired.
      
      Instant Wins can instantly destroy any enemy (except for the Legendary bosses, Armed
        Warriors, Exploding Toads and Spirit Scorpions) if its HP is low enough.
      Bonus Wins are awarded if an enemyâ€™s HP is low enough, and your shot does more.
