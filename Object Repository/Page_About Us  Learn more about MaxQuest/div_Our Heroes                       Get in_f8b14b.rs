                      Our Heroes 
                      Get inspired by these seasoned warriors.
                     
                    
                    
                      
                       
                        
                         
                          
                         
                         
                         Brock Ryder 
                         Weapons Expert 
                         Bounty hunter, hired gun, and on more than one country's most wanted list. Ryder is a thrill seeker who’s always testing the limits (and international laws). 
                         
                        
                        
                         
                          
                         
                         
                         Katie Bennet 
                         Navigation Specialist 
                         Bennett holds several advanced degrees from elite institutions. She uses her training to find her way to where she wants to go. The rest of the Squad knows to follow. 
                         
                        
                        
                         
                          
                         
                         
                         Bruce Tyler 
                         Artillery Mechanic 
                         A war veteran, Tyler's seen plenty of battles. Not that he talks about it much. A man of few words, he fixes things before they break and does what needs doing. 
                         
                        
                        
                         
                          
                         
                         
                         Sam Hudson 
                         Technical Specialist 
                         Give Sam a laptop and an hour and she'll hack her way to whatever information the Squad needs. She's got the deets, and she's a good shot to boot. 
                         
                        
                        
                         
                          
                         
                         
                         Jack Logan 
                         Expert Marksman 
                         Jack by name and by trade, you do not want to caught in his crosshairs. Logan's also a smooth talker, and his most effective weapon by far is his charm.
